    <h1>How Big Are My Dice?</h1>

        their tabletop games, but have you ever wondered
        the exact measurements of yours? Look no further
        than right here. Just type in your measurements, 
        and my brilliant calculator shall solve your 
        conundrum.

    <p>Before we get to the actual dice, there are some
        basic shapes that make up these dice, ie triangles
        and squares. But because I hate myse- am an 
        overachiever, let's go with what makes up the 
        D12, pentagons. Also we're pretending it's a regular
        pentagon. Irregular pentagons would be so much harder.
