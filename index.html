    <p>It's KJ Weidner back at it again, and I don't know what to say about me that I haven't in
        the last three classes I've had here. I still like Pokemon and Dungeons and Dragons, 
        but I've also added World of Darkness to my TTRPG repetoire. I'm still doing theatre shows
        as well, though I need to find a new community theater to join as soon as they start putting
        on shows I'm interested in. I guess I'm also turning 23 this year, so that's pretty cool. 
        I also decided to make a Pokemon Battle Simulator in C++ a couple months ago, it's still 
        a work in progress but I can make the guy hit the other guy and do damage.
